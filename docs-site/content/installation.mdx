title: Installation
description: Install BTMG and connect it to a Neo4j instance to get a shared knowledge graph running in your project.
---

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or later
- Neo4j 5 or later (local instance or AuraDB)

## Install

```bash
npm install btmg-fourthspace
```

## Package Exports

BTMG ships two entry points:

| Export | Description |
|---|---|
| `btmg-fourthspace` | Main API and CLI — entity reads, writes, schema validation, doc sync |
| `btmg-fourthspace/mcp` | MCP server — exposes the graph to AI agents over the Model Context Protocol |

Import the main API in your code:

```ts
import { BTMG } from 'btmg-fourthspace'
```

Import the MCP server separately if you are running it as a standalone process for agent access:

```ts
import { startMcpServer } from 'btmg-fourthspace/mcp'
```

## What Gets Installed

**CLI.** The `btmg` command is added to your path after installation. Use it to manage the graph, run migrations, and sync documentation.

```bash
npx btmg --help
```

**Core API.** The TypeScript API provides typed methods for reading and writing entities, querying temporal state, and managing relationships. All writes are validated through Zod schemas before reaching the graph.

**MCP Server.** The MCP server exposes the graph as a set of tools that AI agents can call via the Model Context Protocol. Agents can read entities, write observations, and query history without direct Neo4j access.

## Connect to Neo4j

Set the following environment variables before running BTMG:

```bash
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-password
```

For AuraDB, use the connection URI provided in the Aura console.

## Verify the Connection

```bash
npx btmg status
```

This checks the Neo4j connection and prints the current graph statistics. If the connection fails, it will print the error and exit with a non-zero code.
